## [1.0.5] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed
- Line 66 runtime error: restored logging helpers at top of script and removed orphaned block
- Keyboard backlight not restoring after resume: add system-sleep hook to save/restore brightness

### Changed
- Folio resume prompt UX: single-key Y/N with 30s timeout; defaults to No when non-interactive

### Notes

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed
- **Issue #83**: Folio keyboard/touchpad not working after suspend/resume. Added optional resume service that reloads HID and attempts USB rebind for folio device. See `gz302-folio-resume.sh` for details and update vendor/product IDs if needed.

### Changed
- **Folio Resume Fix**: Now optional - user is prompted during installation (only install if experiencing the issue)
- **Systemd Resume Service**: When enabled, calls folio resume script for full HID and USB rebind after sleep
- **Documentation**: Updated README.md with folio resume workaround and instructions

### Added
- **Tray Icon Subproject**: Created `tray-icon/` directory for future GUI utility (work in progress)

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-16

### 🎉 Stable Release
First stable release with complete hardware support, modern power management, and all critical issues resolved.

### Fixed
- **Issue #82**: Added missing `reload-hid_asus.service` to fix touchpad detection issues on Arch Linux
- **Issue #82 (suspend/resume)**: Added `reload-hid_asus-resume.service` to fix touchpad gestures after wake from sleep
  - Single-finger movement now works correctly after suspend/resume
  - Module reloads automatically 2 seconds after waking from suspend/hibernate
  - Fixes issue where only two-finger movement worked after resume
- **Critical Bug**: Removed conflicting `rrcfg auto` functionality that caused race conditions with `pwrcfg`
  - Eliminated duplicate auto-switching between pwrcfg and rrcfg
  - Removed rrcfg-auto.service and rrcfg-monitor.service to prevent conflicts
  - Simplified refresh rate management to be controlled solely by pwrcfg
  - Fixed configuration confusion where users had separate AC/Battery profiles for power and refresh

### Added

- **Touchpad Resume Fix**: New systemd service reloads HID module after suspend/resume for gesture support
- **Service Integration**: Automatic enabling of both reload-hid_asus services during hardware setup

### Changed
- **Refresh Rate Management**: `rrcfg` is now manual-only, automatic switching is handled by `pwrcfg config`
- **Documentation**: Updated README.md to clarify that pwrcfg controls both power and refresh rate auto-switching
- **Simplified Architecture**: Reduced gz302-main.sh from 2734 to 2568 lines by removing redundant auto-switching code
